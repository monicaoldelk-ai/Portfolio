<h1>Monica Old Elk-East</h1>
<p>My name is Monica Old Elk-East. I am was born on the Crow Agency Reservation, Montana. My hometown while growing up was in Sierra Vista, Arizona. Upstate New York is my current home of domicile.</p><p>I live with my partner and our two tabby cats. We both have a boy named Nelson and a girl named Princess. We adopted them from the Saratoga Animal Shelter, New York in 2024. They have lived with us for over one year and bring us a lot of joy.</p>

<p>For fun, I enjoy writing, reading, learning, exercising, gaming, putting puzzles together, and hiking the Adirondack Mountains. I also enjoy spending time with my family and friends. Running and listening to music are other passions as it allows me to be outside among nature.</p> <p>Previously, I was an over-the-road truck driver who had her CDL. It has allowed me to drive in 48 states in the United States and in Germany.</p><p>I've recently found myself in the coding world as I am currently taking a Front-End Web Development course through CanCode. CanCode is an organization offered through the state of New York.</p>

<br>
<br><p>I consider myself to be a daring foodie who loves to learn about other cultures through the exploration of different cuisines. In fact, I've even tried grasshoppers in tacos while I visited Washington D.C.</p><p>Life can be short as we never know when it is our time. Yet, amazing stories from diverse cultures of unique perspectives have helped me grow and remain grounded. I have also found this through the connection of food.</p><p>Food for many can be considered a sacred act.</p>
